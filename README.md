3d multiplayer space shooter server prototype using node js

This project was set up to learn nodejs and to create a multi player game using Unity as a client.  Using the following tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-Cz1YO2-mXHMPQayscAYeR4AdwfC29TQ), the project was expanded to 3d and converted to a first person space shooter game with AI and multiple other features.

Node is used as the game server that tracks all players, lobbies and AI.

To start the server: 

-Clone a copy to your local machine
-open a cmd line from the working directory and tpye "cmd" in the windows explorer address bar
-when the cmd line opens, type nodemon index.js to start the server 
-Upon successful start up, the message: "Server has started" will appear
